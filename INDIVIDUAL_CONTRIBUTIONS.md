#### Contribution 2: Unit Testing Implementation
**Description:** Created comprehensive unit tests for GET endpoints in both collections
**Files Created:**
- `tests/users.test.js` - Unit tests for User collection GET endpoints
- `tests/records.test.js` - Unit tests for Record collection GET endpoints
- Updated `package.json` - Added Jest testing framework configuration

**Technical Details:**
- Implemented 4 unit tests for User collection GET endpoints:
  1. GET /user - Authenticated access to all users
  2. GET /user/:id - Specific user retrieval
  3. GET /user - Unauthenticated access (401 test)
  4. GET /user/:id - Invalid ID format test
